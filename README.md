<h1 style="text-align: center;">Homes for Hounds</h1>

![responsiveness](/documentation/am_i_responsive.jpg "Am I Responsive")

This is my website created for my Milestone Project 1 submission as part of my Diploma in Web Development run by Code Institute. The website is a fictional rehoming site for greyhounds. The Homes for Hounds site is currently live, the link can be found [Here](https://lharveydev.github.io/homes-for-hounds/)

## User Experience (UX)

- ### User stories

  - #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to find information about the breed and whether a greyhound would be suitable for me.
    4. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

  - #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to browse for dogs to adopt and determine their suitability.
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.
    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find community links.

  - #### Frequent User Goals
    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new dogs available.

- ### Design
  - #### Colour Scheme
    - The colours I chose reflect the natural environment to appeal to people who enjoy nature and the outdoors. I used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/93032e-c69f89-a6a15e-84894a-034c3c) to select a complimentary colour palette ![colour palette](/documentation/coolers.png "Colour Palette")
  - #### Typography
    - The Ubuntu font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Ubuntu is an informal, friendly font that conveys a welcoming image but is also easy to read and has clean lines.
  - #### Imagery
    - Imagery is important. The large, hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It showcases the appeal of these dogs.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- #### First Time Visitor Goals

  1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

     1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath the title there is a Hero Image. In the bottom half of the index page there is information about the organisation and links to direct the user to relevant pages and furthur reading.
     2. The main points are made immediately with the Hero Image and What We Do section of text.
     3. The user has two options, use the navigation buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

  2. As a First Time Visitor, I want them to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

     1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a navigation bar, each link describes what page they will end up at clearly.
     2. Throughout the site there are links to take the user directly to relevant pages rather than have to scroll up and use the navigation bar.

  3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

     1. Once the new visitor has read the What We Do and Latest News text, they will see the social media links in the footer.
     2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
     3. The Home page contains a testimonial which provides a real life opinion of the organisation and increases trust .
     4. On the Get in Touch page, the user is told that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media and directs them to the links in the footer.

- #### Returning Visitor Goals

  1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to view the new dogs and see the latest news.

     1. These are clearly shown in the nav bar and on the Home page.
     2. Links throughout the Home page direct users to the 'Meet our Dogs' page.

  2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

     1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the 'Contact Us' Page.
     2. Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can email or message the organisation on social media.
     3. The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram page.
     4. Whichever link they click, it will open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.

  3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.

     1. The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.

- #### Frequent User Goals

  1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any news updates.

     1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily find the latest news on the Home page.

  2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new dogs available.

     1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the nav bar tab 'Meet our Dogs' to take them to the page. New arrivals are also flagged in the latest news section on the Home page with a link to the 'Meet our Dogs' page.

### Feedback from User Experience (UX) focus group Section

#### User Feedback

I tested my website on friends, family, work colleagues and fellow students.

- Initial feedback was that the 'Home' page contained too much text and was cluttered and a bit intimidating.
- The large bodies of text and overload of articles, news and information didn't draw the user in on first visit.
- Some of my images overlapped the text on smaller screen sizes.
- My navigation menu did not collapse and was spread over two lines on mobile devices.

#### Response to User Feedback

- Based on this feedback I had a discussion with my mentor who also agreed there was too much text on the 'Home' page. We talked about adding another page to direct users to further information and adding more images to increase the visual experience.
- I created a fourth page titled 'About Us'. The about us, articles and facts & figures section were moved here from the 'Home' page. The number of articles in the articles section were reduced. Three images were added to break up the text in to bite-size reads. Please refer to wireframe Home Page Updated.
- I added Testimonial and How to Volunteer sections to the 'Home' page to increase user engagement.
- I added a collapsible nav bar using bootstrap which converts to a hamburger menu on smaller screens.

### Further Testing

- The website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, ipad air, iPhone7, Samsung Galaxy A20e and in Google developer tools.
- A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
- Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs & Fixes

- Bug - Favicon not working on deployed page.
  Fix - With help from my mentor I understood that the filepath on the deployed page was incorrect and this was an easy fix.
- Bug - Required form fields not working on Samsung Galaxy.  
  Fix - Error in form.html fixed, I had incorrectly closed the form element.
- Bug - On submission my form navigated the user to a submission page outside the website necessitating use of the back button.  
  Fix - I added a target value of blank to open in a new tab..

### Nice to Haves

- I would like to have added a 'return to top' button at the footer of each page.
- I would like to create a pop up box after submitting the contact form saying 'Thanks, we will be in touch soon' I plan to use Javascript to achieve this.
- On Meet our Dogs page I would like a carousel of images to open for each dog.
- On Meet our Dogs page I would like to add a search function to filter between sex of dog, age etc.
