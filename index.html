            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Homes for hounds are a charity dedicated to the re-homing of retired racing greyhounds. These dogs settle
                into retirement easily and make wonderful pets.</p>
            <p>If you are considering re-homing a dog then why not speak to us about our greyhounds. We have dogs
                suitable
                for all types of households including those with children and other animals.</p>
            <p>Greyhounds are easy to keep, they require surprisingly little exercise and are quiet and clean in the
                house.
                they have a naturally calm, laid-back temperament and adapt from life on the track to life on the couch
                with
                ease. </p>
