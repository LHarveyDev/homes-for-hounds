            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Homes for hounds are a charity dedicated to the re-homing of retired racing greyhounds. These dogs settle
                into retirement easily and make wonderful pets.</p>
            <p>If you are considering re-homing a dog then why not speak to us about our greyhounds. We have dogs
                suitable for all types of households including those with children and other animals.</p>
            <p>Greyhounds are easy to keep, they require surprisingly little exercise and are quiet and clean in the
                house. They have a naturally calm, laid-back temperament and adapt from life on the track to life on the
                couch with ease. </p>
            <p>Did you know the greyhound is one of the oldest breeds in history? These noble dogs have been traced back
                over 4,000
                years to early cave drawings and are the only breed mentioned in the Bible. By giving a greyhound a
                home, you are taking
                on a true thoroughbred and a breed that has been “man's best friend” for thousands of years!</p>
