                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Homes for hounds are a charity dedicated to the re-homing of retired racing greyhounds. We were
                    established in 1988 and since then have rehomed many hundreds of retired dogs to their forever
                    homes. These dogs settle into retirement easily and make wonderful pets.
                </p>
                <p>If you are considering re-homing a dog then why not speak to us about our greyhounds. We have dogs
                    suitable for all types of households including those with children and other animals. You can
                    contact us through our <a href="form.html" aria-label="Go to Get in Touch">Get in Touch</a> page.
                </p>
                <p>Greyhounds are easy to keep, they require surprisingly little exercise and are quiet and clean in the
                    house. They have a naturally calm, laid-back temperament and adapt from life on the track to life on
                    the couch with ease.

                        alt="Cave painting of dogs hunting buffalo">Did you know the greyhound is one of the oldest
                    breeds in history? These noble dogs have been traced back over 4,000 years to early cave drawings
                    and are the only breed mentioned in the Bible. By giving a
                    greyhound a home, you are taking on a true thoroughbred and a breed that has been “man's best
                    friend” for thousands of years!
