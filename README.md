<h1 style="text-align: center;">Homes for Hounds</h1>

![responsiveness](/documentation/am_I_responsive.png "Am I Responsive")

This is my website created for my Milestone Project 1 submission as part of my Diploma in Web Development run by Code Institute. The website is a fictional rehoming site for greyhounds.

## User Experience (UX)

- ### User stories

  - #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to find information about the breed and whether a greyhound would be suitable for me.
    4. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

  - #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to browse for dogs to adopt and determine their suitability.
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.
    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find community links.

  - #### Frequent User Goals
    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new dogs available.
    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new articles to read.
    3. As a Frequent User, I want to find out the latest news.

- ### Design
  - #### Colour Scheme
    - The colours I chose reflect the natural environment to appeal to people who enjoy nature and the outdoors. I used coolers to select a complimentary colour palette [Coolers](https://coolors.co/93032e-c69f89-a6a15e-84894a-034c3c) ![colour palette](/documentation/coolers.png "Colour Palette")
  - #### Typography
    - The Ubuntu font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Ubuntu is an informal, friendly font that conveys a welcoming image but is also easy to read and has clean lines.
  - #### Imagery
    - Imagery is important. The large, hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It showcases the appeal of these dogs.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- #### First Time Visitor Goals

  1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

     1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath the title there is a Hero Image. In the bottom half of the index page there is information and links to furthur reading.
     2. The main points are made immediately with the Hero Image and About Us section of text.
     3. The user has two options, use the navigation buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

  2. As a First Time Visitor, I want them to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

     1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what page they will end up at clearly.
     2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
     3. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

  3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
     1. Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.
     2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
     3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

- #### Returning Visitor Goals

  1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to view the new dogs and see the latest news.

     1. These are clearly shown in the nav bar and index page.

  2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

     1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
     2. Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can email or message the organisation on social media.
     3. The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram page.
     4. Whichever link they click, it will open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.

  3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.
     1. The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.

- #### Frequent User Goals

  1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any news updates.

     1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily find the latest news on the Home page.

  2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new dogs available.

     1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the nav bar tab "Meet the Dogs" to take them to the page. New arrivals are also flagged in the latest news section on the Home page.

### Further Testing
